Git hooks for CloudFoundry 
-----------------------------

These are lightweight BASH script hooks for automating a git workflow with cloudfoundry.


post-commit
--------------

This hook assumes that you have set up vmc properly, logged in, and set your vmc target properly as well.

You must set the APPNAME to be your desired cloud foundry application name

     export APPNAME=<appname>

This file you can drop into your .git/hooks directory and it will try to call 

     vmc push $APPNAME

Or equivalently 

     vmc update $APPNAME

if the application already exists on cloudfoundry.com



post-receive
--------------

This hook is to be deposited into a remote repository.  It currently assumes that your vmc set-up, credentials, and target are set properly on that remote repository, so that you are able to vmc push successfully from the shell on that remote repository

You must set the APPNAME to be your desired cloud foundry application name

     export APPNAME=<appname>

Additionally, this application uses the branch name so that you can rapidly update staging and production versions of your application.  If you are committing from the master branch, it performs

     vmc push $APPNAME

If you are staging from any other branch, it utilizes the branch name and performs

     vmc push $APPNAME-$BRANCHNAME

This allows you to rapidly manage multiple staging or test versions on cloudfoundry.com, services by different URL's, and maintain your master version as the main URL.


NOTE: Both of these hooks are in very preliminary form, and so far only tested with locally hosted git repositories, as opposed to having links right now to github, etc.
